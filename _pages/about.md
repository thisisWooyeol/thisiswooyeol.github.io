Hi there👋 This is Wooyeol Lee!

👨‍🎓 I am an undergraduate student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr/). My interests are all the technologies that become part of our lives, such as AI, semiconductor, mobility, quantum computing, metaverse, whatever!! AI, especially, Deep Reinforcement Learning and Robot Learning are my favorites! ["Can machines think?"](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf) What a fancy sentence!! I will post paper reviews, personal projects, etc. at [projects](https://thisiswooyeol.github.io/projects) page steadily:D

🏝 In my freetime, I like to go to the gym and do weight training. I hope I can join 1,000 pounds club in a few years! And I'm a coffee person! The flavor of coffee makes my mind clear and peaceful. I also enjoy experiencing something new! Eating foods from the world and traveling the world always excite me. I'll  post all my personal stories at [blog](https://thisiswooyeol.github.io/blog/) page steadily:D
