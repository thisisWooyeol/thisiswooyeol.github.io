Hi there👋 This is Wooyeol Lee!

👨‍🎓 I am an undergraduate student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr/). My interests are all the AI technologies that become part of our lives, such as LLMs: GPT4, Gemini / autonomous driving: FSD from Tesla / robotics: Optimus Gen 2 from Tesla, an entire building as a robot testbed from [NaverLabs](https://naverlabs.com/), RT-2 from Google DeepMind, ..., whatever!! Especially, Robot Learning is my favorite! I will post paper reviews, personal projects, etc. at [projects](https://thisiswooyeol.github.io/projects) page steadily:D

🏝 In my freetime, I like to go to the gym and do weight training. I hope I can join 1,000 pounds club in a few years! And I'm a coffee person! The flavor of coffee makes my mind clear and peaceful. I also enjoy experiencing something new! Eating foods from the world and traveling the world always excite me. I'll post all my personal stories at [blog](https://thisiswooyeol.github.io/blog/) page steadily:D
