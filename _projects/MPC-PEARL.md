TL;DR:
- MPC-PEARL: a novel combination of meta-RL and MPC with **event-triggered probabilistic switching between the two modules**.
- **Event-triggered switching** makes up for ineffective behaviors of PEARL with MPC, **encouraging exploration of potentially high-reward regions**.
- **Randomization layer** induces MPC-PEARL to learn frequently from actions generated by MPC, thereby **complementing suboptimal MPC actions caused by the limited prediction horizon**.
- **GPR** and **CVaR constraint** are used in MPC **to build safe region constraint with unknown motion of dynamic obstacles**.
- An online adaptdation scheme enables the robot **to infer and adapt to a new task within a single trajectory**.

# Introduction

### Limitations of meta-RL & MPC

As it is crucial for mobile robots to adapt quickly to environmental changes, meta-RL algorithms (e.g. PEARL) are suitable for robot navigation problems. However, the **meta-learned policy may be conservative** in some situations. Another sequential decision-making tool, which is MPC, can be used to infer unknown parts of the system or environmental model with various ML techniques. But, learning-based MPC techniques are **computationally demanding** and MPC optimizes an action sequence within a **fixed short horizon, causing suboptimal, myopic behaviors in general**.

### Motivation of MPC-PEARL

There have been a few attemps to use MPC in model-based meta-RL or meta-learning methods, such as using learned MPC in real-time decision making. However, none of them utilizes the actions generated by MPC in the **training stage**. Motivated by this observation, authors propose a systematic approach to **infusing MPC into the meta-RL training process** for mobile robots in environments cluttered with moving obstacles.
